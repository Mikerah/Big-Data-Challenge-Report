# Big-Data-Challenge-Report

This repository contains the data analysis report I wrote with my teammates for the IBM Big Data Challenge. The  IBM Big Data Challenge is a competition where groups of students undertake an independent research project for a month. The winner gets their complete report published in the STEM Fellowship journal and participants get their abstracts published as well. The theme this year was epidemeology. The topic we chose was how vaccines influence tuberculosis incidence and mortality rates in youth around the world.
